- Cap 1
In the beginning, there were the 6 primordial gods.
They were all very strong and very kind.

- Cap 1.2
But after a while,
They were all bored of having no one to talk to.

- Cap 1.3
So, the god Arouhin decided to create a place
Where small living beings would be. Universes

- Cap 1.4
He had 5: Ilo, Kumal, Ardos, Pamos, Woumo.
All his universes were created to perfection.

- Cap 1.5
So he created small planets in these universes.

To welcome his small beings.

- Cap 1.6
But the god Destructos,
I wanted to destroy them all.

- Cap 1.7
So when Arouhin heard this,
He got angry and started a battle against him.

- Cap 1.8
They fought.
But, during the battle
Destructos managed to destroy 4 universes:
Ilo, Kumal, Pamos, Woumo.

- Cap 1.9
Arouhin then said to himself that he would always protect Ardos.
No matter the consequences.

- Cap 2
After all this mess,
Arouhin decided to create several living species, including humans.
and several objects like trees.

- Cap 2.1
Arouhin's brother was named Égalis.
He was really strong.
He could create liquids as he wanted.
So, he decided to create oceans.

- Cap 2.2
Oceans are places where there is plenty of water.
So Arouhin added thirst to humans.
So that water would be necessary.

- Cap 2.3
He, Arouhin's cousin, was named Morphie.
He controlled materials like
Solid, liquid and gas.

- Cap 2.4
So he decided to add something in his own way.
Air, something you have to breathe to live.

- Cap 2.5
But for all this to work,
We need someone to control nature!
Plants, earth and all that.

- Cap 2.6
His name was Calkère.
He was the most beautiful of the gods, he was muscular and strong.
and he was Destructos' best friend.

- Cap 2.7
But for all this, you need heat.
So Arouhin volunteered to create a giant.
Ball of fire. He named her Solestos.

- Cap 2.8
The one and only goddess was called Artemaise.
She managed everything related to life.
In short, she managed everything that was alive.
She could modify their behaviors, their bodies, their hair, etc.

- Cap 2.9
Some time after creating the planets.
Arouhin realized that species died at some point.

- Cap 3
But he didn't know that it was Destructos who was trying.
To make the souls come out of the bodies of living creatures.

- Cap 3.1
So he decided to create a place
Where to revive them or even make them a Paradise habitat.
Or that he would welcome all pure souls.
I'm talking about the Paq.

- Cap 3.2
Pure souls are people who have not done any Cayo
So no stupidity or wickedness in their life

- Cap 3.3
So, when Destructos saw that he was no longer able to suck up souls,
He knew that the god of creation had something to do with it.

- Cap 3.4
He created L’enq, a place where all the bad souls
Would meet. Because,
The power of the good side was stronger.

- Cap 3.5
When Arouhin knew this, he swore that he
Would protect all the good souls without Cayo
and send them to Paq.

- Cap 3.6
Even though Destructos had just learned that Arouhin created Paq,
He decided not to put more force into getting the good souls.

- Cap 3.7
Because he believed that all species in the universe
Would do bad things.

- Cap 3.8
But at a random moment...
Égalis and Artemaise were touching each other strangely.
But all of a sudden,
A small species with powers appeared.
It was Cogar. He could control the universe.
So the planets and the Solestos.

- Cap 3.9
When Arouhin saw this, he immediately said to himself that
We should add a way to do that too.

- Cap 4
So Calkère created the Sixe, a way to reproduce.
He added Sixuel mechanics to the human.

- Cap 4.1
Like that, Arouhin's perfections,
Will be able to appear on their own.

- Cap 4.2
Unfortunately, he decided to add a way that hurts.
After making the Sixe, you have to wait about 9 months.
and take the baby out of the back of the species.

- Cap 4.3
The good thing about this is that when someone gives birth,
You should always know that at least one god is in the room.
With you.

- Cap 4.4
Even though that was perfect, he decided to add several Sixes to some species.
So he created the Male and the Female.

- Cap 4.5
Several Sixes to allow the creation
Of other species while having more fun

- Cap 4.6
Unfortunately, he didn't manage to add this to everyone.
So he just decided to allow the other species
To be able to reproduce alone.
By having the same fun.

- Cap 4.7
After having done this,
So that the gods would not have to move.

- Cap 4.8
He created the anga,
Little gods that would be attributed to all living beings.

- Cap 4.9
He then named 12:
Berri, Monroyal, Pissounet, Ohyo, Viva, Tou, Prix, Uni, Wy, Ouioui, Wiui, Papi

- Cap 5
All these angels had abilities to give to their beings.
The 1-3 could give Strength.
The 4-7 could give protection.
The 8-10 could give confidence.
The 11-12 could give bravery.

- Cap 5.1
Now for the Demo, he named 6.
Deumilvindcinq, Danator, Slachkil, Yogor, Kondore, Grani

- Cap 5.2
When Arouhin created this, everyone agreed.
Except 1…
Destructos.

- Cap 5.3
He Destructos decided to create the Demo.
Same as the Anga, except they are evil.

- Cap 5.4
Those who did not believe in religion.
Had no protection from the gods.
and no anga.

- Cap 5.5
So maybe the non-believers had a personal Demo.
Instead of an Anga.

- Cap 5.6
In short, this is the beginning of the universe.

- Cap 5.7
Now I will introduce you to the 9 main Cayos;
- Kill
- Swear and break your promise.
- Blaspheme
- Anger (too exaggerated)
- Lust
- Destroy something sacred
- Greed (To a point of theft)
- Rebellion
- Disbelief

- Cap 5.8
If you do not respect these main Cayos,
You will never be able to be forgiven.

- Cap 5.9
The only way to be forgiven is to respect/do the
3 Maritian values:
- Charity
- Justice
- Honor

- Cap 6
Unfortunately, if you do not respect the main Cayos,
There is no going back.
The only Cayos that can be forgiven are all
Except the main ones.

- Cap 6.1
Okay, now we have talked a lot about the good side of things.
Now, we should go to the slightly darker side.
A side that you do not want to go, but you must know to be a good believer.

- Cap 6.2
First, if you go to Enq YOU cannot go near the mansion.

This mansion is very dangerous and protected by dangerous Demos.

This place inhabits the famous Destructos (the original Demo)

- Cap 6.3
Once you are at Enq there is no exit.
The only Demo that can transport you to the Paq is Destructos himself.

- Cap 6.4
You will have to work in the Enq until you suffer.

You will never have a break.
Unless Destructos decides.

- Cap 6.5
YOU will not be able to sleep.
So, no sleep, and you are always tired.

- Cap 6.6
The ultimate rule that must not be broken is…
Do not speak the name of the gods or the Anga
Otherwise you will suffer the wrath of Destructos.

- Cap 6.66
He will make you suffer.
And devour your soul.

- Cap 6.7
The only way to stop the wrath of Destructos
Including natural disasters
Is to make a sacrifice.
In glory to this bad Demo

- Cap 6.8
If you die in any way,
You will reappear in Enq
And if you have a pen,
It will be reset to 0.

- Cap 6.9
The person who has worked the most in Enq will have Advantages.
Go to the manor
Be able to sleep (A bed not comfortable)
Talk to the Original Demo

- Cap 7
Here are the numbers of the Paq and the Enq
Number of the Paq is 777 (Do not say if you are in Enq)

The meaning of the number: 777 is that there is hope

Because after 6 there is the number 7 and the 6 means despair.

Number of the Enq is 666 (Do not say if you are in Paq)

No precise meaning.

- Cap 7.1
The thing to remember is that you MUST NOT say 666.
It is a cursed number. It means despair.
If you say it, a Demo can come to you
And maybe do something to you…

- Cap 7.2
But even if all this is perfect, you still have to
Keep in mind that Destructos is still there.
He eats souls to gain his physical form.

- Cap 7.3
But even if he tries
The good side manages to fight against him.

- Cap 7.4
Let's get back to the story.

- Cap 7.5
After creating the Demo and the Anga Destructos and Arouhin.
Arouhin decided to send humans with orange hair.
The Redheads.
Humans who were elected by Arouhin himself.

- Cap 7.6
Redheads are living beings who are the Messiahs of Arouhin.
All redheads have powers.
Including better fertility

- Cap 7.7
If you see a redhead,
This is a sign from God.

- Cap 7.8
Even if redheads are quite good,
There are even stronger ones.

- Cap 7.9
Including Lamamel, an outstanding fighter.
He was sent to Earth with the other humans.
And he built a very strong and majestic species.

- Cap 8
When the gods decided to create Lamamel
Destructos decided to create Murder,
The son of Destructos.

- Cap 8.1
To inhabit his chosen ones,
Arouhin created the Capcha
A sacred place

- Cap 8.2
This magical place inhabited Anga and gods.
Would meet again

- Cap 8.3
And where we could forgive the Cayo
Without having to do the Maritian values.
Just a place where we would make a donation.
To be forgiven

- Cap 8.4
At that moment,
Artemaise decided to create emotion.
Something that the being would feel.
That would make him happy!

- Cap 8.5
When the information reached Destructos,
He decided to corrupt the spell
And added two new emotions.
Sadness, anger and pain

- Cap 8.6
When they are in the pure form of anger,
It corrupts the people who were originally supposed to go to Paq.
We have a destiny to go to Enq.

- Cap 8.7
When someone is sad in the pure form of sadness,
There is no more reason to live.
And this can cause one to kill oneself, therefore a Cayo.

- Cap 8.8
And finally, It, pain, it allows one to make suffer.
and to torture people without them knowing it.

- Cap 8.9
That's why you have to stay on the good side.
Because destructos is always close to you.

- Cap 9
Now, we should talk
About diminutives

- Cap 9.1
The Packin
are those who worship God.
And who believe in the Caplot.
So, those on the good side of the force.

- Cap 9.2
They can invoke the Anga.
Very easily, by contacting them.
Spiritually.
Or in dreams.

- Cap 9.3
Otherwise, there are the Capta of people
Who know the Caplot as if they had created it.
These people are often sheltered in the Capcha
The place where they can be contacted.
Their extraordinary spirits are used to help the lost.

- Cap 9.4
The Equi
are those who believe in Destructos.
They worship evil.
So, they are bad people.

- Cap 9.5
They, the Enquis can invoke it.
By doing a very secret ritual.
And precise.
There are ONLY A FEW people who know it.
But they can talk to them from beyond the world.

- Cap 9.6
Otherwise, there are the Enwis, they are very special.
They are close to the Demos and appreciate them very much.
He is able to summon the Demos by doing rituals.
Who is specialized in it.
Be careful, because they are very rare to find!

- Cap 9.7
These two kinds are very different.
The Enquis can summon physical forms.
While the Packin spiritual forms
This is also seen in the character; the Enqui are more impatient and unchalant.

- Cap 9.8

- Cap 9.9
