- Cap 1
In the beginning there were the 6 primordial gods.
They were all very strong and very kind

- Cap 1.2
But after a while,
They were all bored of having no one to talk to

- Cap 1.3
So, the god Arouhin decided to create a place
Where small living beings would be. Universes

- Cap 1.4
He had 5; Ilo, Kumal, Ardos, Pamos, Woumo
All his universes were created to perfection.

- Cap 1.5
So he created small planets in these universes.

To welcome his small beings.

- Cap 1.6
But the god Destructos,
Wanted to destroy them all.

- Cap 1.7
So when Arouhin heard this,
He got angry and started a battle against him.

- Cap 1.8
They fought
But, during the battle
Destructos managed to destroy 4 universes;
Ilo, Kumal, Pamos, Woumo.

- Cap 1.9
Arouhin then said to himself that he would always protect Ardos
No matter the consequences.

----------------------------------

- ​​Cap 2
After all this mess,
Arouhin decided to create several living species including humans
and several objects like Trees.

- Cap 2.1
Arouhin's brother, he was named Égalis
He was really strong,
He could create liquids as he wanted
So, he decided to create Oceans.

- Cap 2.2
Oceans are places where there is plenty of water
So Arouhin added thirst to humans
So that water is necessary.

- Cap 2.3
He, Arouhin's cousin was named Morphie
He controlled materials like
Solid, liquid and gas.

- Cap 2.4
So he decided to add something in his own way.
Air, something you have to breathe to live

- Cap 2.5
But for all this to work.
We need someone to control nature!
Plants, earth and all that.

- Cap 2.6
His name was Calkère
He was the most beautiful of the gods, he was muscular and strong
and he was Destructos' best friend.

- Cap 2.7
But for all this you need heat.
So Arouhin volunteered to create a giant
Fireball. He named her Solestos

- Cap 2.8
The one and only goddess was called Artemaise
She managed everything related to life.
In short, she managed everything that was alive.
She could modify their behaviors, their bodies, their hair, etc.

- Cap 2.9
Some time after creating the planets.
Arouhin realized that species died at some point.

----------------------------------

- ​​Cap 3
But he didn't know that it was Destructos who was trying
To get the souls out of the bodies of living creatures.

- Cap 3.1
So he decided to create a place
Where to revive them or even make them a Paradise habitat
Or that he would welcome all pure souls
I'm talking about Paq

- Cap 3.2
Pure souls are people who have not done any Cayo
So no stupidity or wickedness in their lives

- Cap 3.3
So when Destructos saw that he was not able - Able to suck up souls.
He knew that the god of creation had something to do with it.

- Cap 3.4
He created L'enq, a place where all bad souls
Would meet. Because,
The power of the good side was stronger.

- Cap 3.5
When Arouhin knew this, he swore that he
Would protect all good souls without Cayo
and send them to Paq.

- Cap 3.6
Even though Destructos had just learned that Arouhin created the Paq,
He decided not to put more force into getting the good souls.

- Cap 3.7
Because he believed that all the species in the universe,
Were going to do bad things

- Cap 3.8
But at a random moment…
Égalis and Artemaise were touching each other strangely
But all of a sudden,
A small species with powers appeared.
It was Cogar. He could control the universe
So the planets and the Solestos.

- Cap 3.9
When Arouhin saw this, he immediately said to himself that.
We would have to add a way to do that too.

----------------------------------

- ​​Cap 4
So Calkère created the Sixe, a way to reproduce.
He added Sixuel mechanics to the human.

- Cap 4.1
Like this, the perfections of Arouhin,
Will be able to appear by themselves.

- Cap 4.2
Unfortunately he decided to add a means that hurts.
After having made the Sixth one must wait about 9 months
and take the baby out of the back of the species.

- Cap 4.3
The good thing with this is that when someone gives birth.
You must always know that at least one god is in the room
with you.

- Cap 4.4
Even if that is perfect he decided to add to some species several Sixes.
So he created the Male and the Female.

- Cap 4.5
Several Sixes to allow creating
Other species while having more fun

- Cap 4.6
Unfortunately, he didn't manage to add this to everyone
So he just decided to allow other species
To be able to reproduce alone
While having the same fun.

- Cap 4.7
After having done this,
So that the gods would not have to move.

- Cap 4.8
He created the anga,
Little gods that would be attributed to all living beings

- Cap 4.9
He then named 12:
Berri, Monroyal, Pissounet, Ohyo, Viva, Tou, Prix, Uni, Wy, Ouioui, Wiui, Papi

----------------------------------

- ​​Cap 5
All these angels had abilities to give to their beings
The 1-3 could give Strength
The 4-7 could give Protection
The 8-10 could give Confidence
The 11-12 could give Bravery

- Cap 5.1
Now for the demons, he named 6
Deumilvindcinq, Danator, Slachkil, Yogor, Kondore, Grani

- Cap 5.2
When Arouhin created this, everyone agreed
Except 1…
Destructos.

- Cap 5.3
He Destructos decided to create the Demo
Same as the Anga, except they are evil.

- Cap 5.4
Those who did not believe in religion.

Had no protection from gods
and no anga.

- Cap 5.5
So maybe the non-believers had a personal Demo
Instead of an Anga.

- Cap 5.6
In short, this is the beginning of the universe

- Cap 5.7
Now I will introduce you to the 9 main Cayo;
Kill
Swear and break your promise
Blaspheme
Anger (Too exaggerated)
Lust
Destroy something sacred
Greed (At a point of theft)
Revolt
Do not believe

- Cap 5.8
If you do not respect its main Cayo
You will never be able to be forgiven

- Cap 5.9
The only way to be forgiven is to respect/do the
3 Maritian Values:
Charity
Justice
Honor

----------------------------------

- ​​Cap 6
Unfortunately if you do not respect the Main Cayo,
There is no going back
The only Cayos that can be forgiven are all
Except the main ones

- Cap 6.1
Well now we have talked a lot about the good side of things
Now we should go to the slightly darker side
A side that you do not want to go to but that you must know to be a good believer

- Cap 6.2
First, if you go to hell YOU can't go near the mansion.
This mansion is very dangerous and protected by dangerous Demos.
This place inhabits the famous Destructos (The original Demo)

- Cap 6.3
Once you are at the Enq there is no exit.
The only Demo capable of transporting you to Heaven is Destructos, Himself.

- Cap 6.4
You will have to work in the Enq until you Suffer
You will never have a break
Unless Destructos decides

- Cap 6.5
YOU will not be able to sleep
So no sleep and you are always tired

- Cap 6.6
The ultimate rule not to break is..
Do not pronounce the name of the Gods or the Anga
Otherwise you will suffer the wrath of Destructos

- Cap 6.66
He will make you suffer
And devour your soul

- Cap 6.7
The only way to stop the wrath of Destructos
Whose Natural Disasters
Is to make a sacrifice
In glory to this evil Demo

- Cap 6.8
If you die in any way,
You will reappear in Enq
And if you have a pen,
It will be reset to 0

- Cap 6.9
The person who has worked the most in Enq will have Advantages
Go to the Manor
Be able to sleep (A bed that is not comfortable)
Talk to the Original Demo

----------------------------------

- ​​Cap 7
Here are the numbers of the Paq and the Enq
Number of the Paq 777 (Do not say if you are at the Enq)
The meaning of the number: 777 is that there is hope
Because after 6 there is the number 7 and the 6 means despair.

Number of the Enq 666 (Do not say if you are at the Paq)
No precise meaning.

- Cap 7.1
What you have to remember is that you MUST not pronounce 666.
It is a cursed number. It means despair.
If you say it a Demo can come see you
And maybe do something to you..

- Cap 7.2
But even if all this is perfect you still have to
Keep in mind that Destructos is still there
He eats souls to gain his Physical form.

- Cap 7.3
But even if he tries
The good side manages to fight against him

- Cap 7.4
Let's get back to the story.

- Cap 7.5
After creating the Demo and the Anga Destructos and Arouhin.
Arouhin decided to send humans with orange hair
The Redheads.
Humans who were elected by Arouhin himself.

- Cap 7.6
Redheads are living beings who are the Messiahs of Arouhin
All redheads have powers.
Including better fertility

- Cap 7.7
If you see a redhead,
This is a sign from god.

- Cap 7.8
Even if redheads are pretty cool
There are even stronger ones

- Cap 7.9
Including Lamamel, an outstanding fighter.
He was sent to earth with the other humans
And he beat a very strong and majestic species.

----------------------------------

- ​​Cap 8
When the gods decided to create Lamamel
Destructos decided to create Murder,
The son of Destructos.

- Cap 8.1
To inhabit his chosen ones,
Arouhin created the Capcha
A sacred place

- Cap 8.2
This magical place inhabited Anga and gods
Would meet again

- Cap 8.3
And where we could forgive the Cayo
Without having to do the Maritian values
Only a place where we would make a donation
To be forgiven

- Cap 8.4
At that moment,
Artemaise decided to create emotion
Something that the being would feel
Which would make him happy!

- Cap 8.5
QWhen the information reached Destructos,
He decided to corrupt the spell.
And added two new emotions.
Sadness, anger and pain

- Cap 8.6
When they are in the pure form of anger,
It corrupts people who were originally supposed to go to Paq
We have a destiny to go to Enq.

- Cap 8.7
When someone is sad in the pure form of sadness,
There is no more reason to live
And this can cause them to kill themselves, therefore a Cayo.

- Cap 8.8
And finally. It is pain that allows people to suffer
and torture people without them knowing it.

- Cap 8.9
That's why you have to stay on the good side
Because Destructos is always close to you.

----------------------------------

- ​​Cap 9
Now we should talk
About the diminutives

- Cap 9.1
The Packin
Are those who worship god
And who believe in the Caplot
So those on the good side of the force

- Cap 9.2
They can invoke the Anga.
Very easily by contacting them
Spiritually.
Or in dreams.

- Cap 9.3
Otherwise there are the Capta of the People
Who know the Caplot as if they had created it.
These people are often sheltered in the Capcha
The place where they can be contacted.
His extraordinary spirits are used to help the lost.

- Cap 9.4
The Equi
Are those who believe in Destructos
They love evil
So they are bad people

- Cap 9.5
They, the Enquis can summon him
By doing a very secret ritual
And precise.
There is ONLY ONE person who knows it.
But they can talk to him in another world.

- Cap 9.6
Otherwise there are the Enwis, they are very special
They are close to the Demo and appreciate them a lot
He is able to summon the Demos by doing rituals
Who is specialized in it
Be careful because they are very rare to find!

- Cap 9.7
His two genders are very different,
The enquis can summon physical forms
While the Packin can summon spiritual forms
This can also be seen in the character; the Enqui are more impatient and not charming.

- Cap 9.8

- Cap 9.9
